# Centralized Hub Architecture - Lightwave AI ChatBot System

## Overview
Your AI ChatBot system now implements a **centralized hub architecture** where all customer interactions begin in a general chat and are intelligently routed to specialized departments as needed.

## How It Works

### 1. **Central Entry Point (General Chat)**
- **All customers start here**: Every new chat session begins with Alex, the main Lightwave assistant
- **Smart Routing**: Alex analyzes customer messages and routes them to appropriate specialists
- **Unified Experience**: Customers get a consistent entry point regardless of their specific needs

### 2. **Hub-and-Spoke Model**
```
           Customer Start Here
                    ↓
          ┌─────────────────────────┐
          │   GENERAL CHAT (HUB)    │
          │      Alex - Main        │
          │   Lightwave Assistant   │
          └─────────────────────────┘
                    │
        ┌───────────┼───────────────────────┐
        ↓           ↓           ↓           ↓
   ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐
   │  SALES  │ │TECHNICAL│ │ SUPPORT │ │ BILLING │
   │  Sarah  │ │  Mike   │ │  Emma   │ │  David  │
   │Specialist│ │Specialist│ │Specialist│ │Specialist│
   └─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘
```

### 3. **Intelligent Routing System**
