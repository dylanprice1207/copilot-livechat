## 🔐 Access Control Implementation

### Service Agent Detection
```javascript

    const userRole = sessionStorage.getItem('userRole') || 'org-admin';
    const serviceAgentRoles = ['service-agent', 'global_admin', 'super_admin'];
    
    if (userRole === 'org-admin' || serviceAgentRoles.includes(userRole)) {
        return true;
    }
    
    showNotification('Access denied: Service agent privileges required', 'error');
    return false;
};
```

### CSS-Based Hiding
```css
.service-agent-only {
    display: none !important;
}

.service-agent .service-agent-only {
    display: flex !important;
}
```

### Backend Validation
```javascript
const requireAdminAccess = async (req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.user || !['global_admin', 'admin'].includes(req.user.role)) {
        return res.status(403).json({ 
            success: false, 
            message: 'Admin access required' 
        });
    }
    next();
};
```
