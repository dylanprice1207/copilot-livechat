# ConvoAI Service Portal - Issues Fixed & User Management

## üêõ Knowledge Base Error Fixed

### Problem
The server was repeatedly failing with:
```
‚ùå ConvoAI KnowledgeBase: Initialization attempt 1 failed: this.loadKnowledgeBase is not a function
‚ùå ConvoAI KnowledgeBase: Initialization attempt 2 failed: this.loadKnowledgeBase is not a function
‚ùå ConvoAI KnowledgeBase: Initialization attempt 3 failed: this.loadKnowledgeBase is not a function
```

### Root Cause
The `KnowledgeBaseService.js` was calling `this.loadKnowledgeBase()` method which didn't exist in the class. The method was available in the MongoDB version but missing from the main service file.

### Solution
Fixed by replacing calls to `this.loadKnowledgeBase()` with `this.loadKnowledgeBaseFromFiles()` in two locations:
- Line 60: In the initialization timeout race condition
- Line 996: In the category rename reload function

### Result
‚úÖ **Knowledge Base now initializes successfully with 206 entries**
‚úÖ **No more initialization retry loops**
‚úÖ **Server starts cleanly without errors**
